            <p>Pokémon, short for "Pocket Monsters," is a media franchise created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori. It centers around fictional creatures called "Pokémon," which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport. The franchise began with a pair of video games for the original Game Boy and has since expanded into trading card games, animated TV series, movies, toys, and more.</p>
